# Notes:
# this: (#!/usr/bin/env ruby) is a shebang and is used to indicate what interpreter should be used to read the code in this file.
# puts bin/run when want to test this lab.
# binding.pry
#see tic tac toe labs 'bin' files as explains how to 'launch'  user_interface from this file e.g. new tic tac toe game.
# note:
# When we execute code through the ruby interpreter with the ruby command, your shell or terminal has already given the ruby command permission to execute code.
# But in order for your shell to execute a file via a command like ./bin/<file name>, you have to grant it execute permissions. We do this using the chmod command. You can grant a file execute permissions with:
# $ chmod +x  
# So to grant a file bin/tictactoe permissions to execute, you would run: chmod +x bin/tictactoe. Depending on your shell environment and user, you might need to run chmod with sudo (sudo chmod +x bin/tictactoe).
